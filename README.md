# morse-translator

This is the repo for my morse code translator project. For this project, I created a web page Morse Code translator.

This project required me to utilise the following tech stack:

-   HTML
-   SCSS
-   javascript
-   modules
-   unit testing

I originally struggled with how to tackle this project, thinking of attacking it using an API. In the end, I created an object with the morse code key and manipulated the data and DOM using javascript. I created a unit-test to validate the code was working correctly.
